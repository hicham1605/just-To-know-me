Hi, my name is Hicham Ouzddou. I’m 21 years old and I live in Agadir, Morocco. I’m passionate about programming and am currently focused on learning the Go and C languages. I recently completed a pool of 1337, which has been a significant milestone in my programming journey. I’m enthusiastic about developing my skills further and exploring new technologies.
